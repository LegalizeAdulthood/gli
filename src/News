GLI V4.5

   o  A demonstration script (glitcldemo) for generating three-dimensional
      surfaces is provided as a skeleton for Tcl/Tk beginners.

   o  GLI/GKS generated PostScript files may now be converted to Adobe's
      Illustrator format with GhostScript's ps2ai filter.

   o  GLI/GKS has been ported to Linux using the gcc, g77 and/or f2c
      compilers.

   o  Shared Libraries are now provided for AIX, Digital UNIX, IRIX and
      SunOS operating systems.

   o  GLI/GKS now contains a logical device driver for GKSM metafiles.
      The GKSM device driver is intended for real-time applications
      that require a graphics output device with minimum overhead.

   o  GLI V4.5 provides full Tcl/Tk support. Once, a Tcl interpreter
      has been registered with the SET TCL command, GLI may process any
      Tcl or Tk (widget) command. GLI/GKS graphics may be routed into
      pre-existing Tk widgets.

   o  GLI/GKS now allows double buffering on X displays. Set the
      GLI_GKS_DOUBLE_BUF environment variable to enable this feature.
      For most applications, using this switch results in substantially
      smoother display.      

   o  The VIEW command has been renamed to IMPORT. The TEKtronix input
      filter has been further improved.

   o  The GLI/IMAGE allows Fast fourier transforms on images. Several
      filters may be used to manipulate your data (highpass, lowpass,
      bandpass, notch).
