	GLI V4.5
	========

This README file will explain how to set up GLI for UNIX systems.
For UNIX systems, the basic instructions are as follows:

  o First you must prepare to copy over the GLI distribution. From the root
    account on your machine switch to a suitable working directory (other
    than /usr/local), e.g.:

        cd /tmp <RETURN>

    This is where you will need extract the tar file containing GLI V4.5.
    You will require about 16MB of disk space by the time you are finished.

  o Now you should uncompress and extract the tar file. You should type:

        gunzip gli-4.5.30.tar.gz
        tar xv gli-4.5.30.tar

  o Move to the "gli/src" dierctory:

        cd gli/src

  o Type "./configure". This will prepare the GLI source code to be
    built on your platform.

  o Type "make". This will create GLI's libraries and executables.

  o Type "make install" to install GLI's binaries and script files in
    standard places.

  o You may now logout of the root account and log into a non-privileged
    account. After logged into a new account you have to setup your user
    environment. To do this type:

	source /usr/local/gli/glisetup.csh

  o To initialize the GLI program you should type:

	gli <RETURN>

  o To start the demonstration, at the gli> prompt you should type:

	gli> demo <RETURN>
	  or (if you are using an X display)
	gli> xdemo <RETURN>
	  or
	gli> image_demo <RETURN>
	  or (if you have Tcl/Tk installed on your system)
	gli> tcldemo <RETURN>
